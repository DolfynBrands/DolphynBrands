# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing single-page application (SPA) with proper URL routing and dynamic meta tags to improve SEO performance. The current application uses client-side state management for navigation, which prevents search engines from properly indexing individual pages and limits user experience with bookmarking and sharing specific pages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want each page to have its own unique URL, so that I can bookmark, share, and navigate directly to specific pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to different sections THEN the browser URL SHALL update to reflect the current page
2. WHEN a user bookmarks a page URL THEN they SHALL be able to return directly to that specific page
3. WHEN a user shares a page URL THEN the recipient SHALL land on the correct page content
4. WHEN a user uses browser back/forward buttons THEN navigation SHALL work correctly between pages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a search engine crawler, I want to access individual pages through unique URLs, so that I can properly index and rank each page separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search engine crawls the site THEN each page SHALL be accessible via a unique URL path
2. WHEN crawling occurs THEN URLs SHALL follow RESTful conventions (e.g., /about, /brands, /contact)
3. WHEN accessing any valid route directly THEN the page SHALL load correctly without 404 errors
4. WHEN invalid routes are accessed THEN a proper 404 page SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want each page to have relevant and unique meta information, so that search results and social media shares display appropriate titles and descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the browser title SHALL reflect the specific page content
2. WHEN sharing on social media THEN each page SHALL display unique Open Graph meta tags
3. WHEN search engines index pages THEN each page SHALL have unique meta descriptions
4. WHEN navigating between pages THEN meta tags SHALL update dynamically without page refresh

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the routing system to be maintainable and scalable, so that adding new pages is straightforward and doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new routes THEN the process SHALL be simple and follow established patterns
2. WHEN routes are defined THEN they SHALL be centralized and easy to manage
3. WHEN lazy loading is implemented THEN it SHALL work seamlessly with the new routing system
4. WHEN the application builds THEN all routes SHALL be properly bundled and optimized

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want the SEO improvements to maintain current performance characteristics, so that user experience is not degraded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN performance SHALL be equal to or better than current implementation
2. WHEN lazy loading occurs THEN it SHALL continue to work with proper loading states
3. WHEN animations trigger THEN they SHALL work correctly with the new routing system
4. WHEN the application is built THEN bundle sizes SHALL not significantly increase
